# Gena-Beauty-Main-Window
Ali Itayem 2006

This is a graphical user interface written in python code to display a treeview with an inventory of the Gena Beauty Supply store.
This program allows its users to search any product by the barcode, name, brand, category, or id. It also, uses a barcode scanner to 
automatically search the database by binding the return key, which the barcode scanner activates after every scan, to a search function.

There is also a button labeled "Cart Mode" which brings us to the second file and window where we use the barcode scanner to add products 
from one MySQL table (products table) too the other ()cart
